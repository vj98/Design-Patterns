# Design Patterns
In software engineering, a software design pattern is a general, reusable solution to a commonly occurring problem within a given context in software design. It is not a finished design that can be transformed directly into source or machine code.

There are 3 main groups of patterns

* [Creational Design Patterns](https://github.com/vj98/Design-Patterns/tree/master/Creational%20Design%20Patterns)
   * [Factory Method](https://github.com/vj98/Design-Patterns/tree/master/Creational%20Design%20Patterns/Factory%20Method)
  *  [Abstract Factory Pattern](https://github.com/vj98/Design-Patterns/tree/master/Creational%20Design%20Patterns/Abstract%20Factory%20Pattern)
* Structural Design Patterns
* Behavioral Design Patterns
