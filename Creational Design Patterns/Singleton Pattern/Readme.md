# Singleton Pattern
Singleton is a creational design pattern that lets you ensure that a class has only one instance, while providing a global access point to this instance.

There are two forms of singleton design pattern
* Early Instantiation: creation of instance at load time.
* Lazy Instantiation: creation of instance when required.obal access point to this instance.
